- 👋 Hi, I’m @PersonIKnow
- 👀 I’m interested in making video games in the future but for now just learning how to program is fun
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java at uni. I want to learn c# and c++ at least in the future though
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, probably just with friends until I get a job
- 📫 How to reach me zachary1.voce@gmail.com

Things to add to Github:
- Mods from Terraria's TModLoader, Specifically the content mod and Better Master Mode.
- Games I've made in Already made game engines (such as Unity and Unreal Engine), If I end up doing that while in Uni.
- Put Custom game Engine (Along with what I made with the engine).\

**MAKE SURE TO PUT STUFF IN THE README.TXT, IN THE REPOSITORY, STUFF LIKE:** 
  - *I implemented the UI using framework X.*
  - *The hardest problem I had to solve was Y.*
  - *The longest problem to debug was Z.*
  - *I would do W differently using U and V.*
  - *etc.*\

**TO SHOW THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN AND THAT I CAN REFLECT ON WHAT I'VE DONE AND HOW TO IMRPOVE ON MY WORK.**
